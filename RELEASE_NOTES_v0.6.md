# Release v0.6: The "ANO" Rebrand

**ANO: The Party Drawing Game** is here! This release candidate brings a massive identity overhaul, shifting from "Ano-Draw" to the sleeker, punchier "ANO". We've focused on creating a "mobile-first chaos" vibe with premium assets and a polished user experience.

## 🎨 The Rebrand
*   **New Name**: Officially rebranded to **ANO**.
*   **New Look**:
    *   **App Icon**: A bold, geometric design blending neon chaos with a dark mode aesthetic.
    *   **Internal Logo**: Refined text-and-shapes logo for a cleaner in-app look.
    *   **Marketing Assets**: New "Art Studio Chaos" Open Graph image for social sharing.
*   **Documentation**: Completely rewritten `README.md` to reflect the new "party game" direction.

## 🚀 Enhancements
*   **Unified Branding**: Consistent logo usage across PWA home screen, splash screens, and internal assets.
*   **Metadata**: Updated `manifest.json` and `index.html` for better SEO and installability.
*   **Stability**: Solidified the state machine for smoother game flow (Lobby -> Draw -> Vote).

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Coming Soon
*   **Powerups**: The powerup system is currently being finalized and will be fully polished in the v1.0 release.
